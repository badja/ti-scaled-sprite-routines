This archive contains two sprite routines which allow you to draw sprites at
a fraction of their stored size. The sprites may be drawn with a scale factor
anywhere from 0.4 to 100% -- so sprites can only be scaled down, not enlarged.
Also included is a supplementary routine for calculating scaled sprite sizes.

The sprites have no size limit and may be LDed, ORed or XORed to the graph buffer.
See the comments in the appropriate routine INC file for details on each
routine. See the sample programs for examples on how to use the routines.

You may use these routines in your own programs, as long as you give me
credit.

putScaledSprite
---------------
This routine is smaller and faster. Use this if you don't require clipping.

getScaledSpriteClip
-------------------
This routine is larger and slower, but provides clipping so that any parts
of the sprite off-screen will not be drawn.

getScaledSize
-------------
This is a handy little routine which calculates the size that the sprite will
be after scaling. It is useful for determining the coordinates at which a
sprite is to be displayed when the scaled size is unknown.


Note : To compile the demo programs for the TI82 you have to uncomment the line
;#define TI82
at the beginning of the file.
